            Creativity and logic have always had a definite place in my heart. Coming from a background of specialty training in mathematics and informatics, followed by a BA in Performance Arts, my practical and creative sides have been trying to meet in the middle for quite some time, and when I discovered the possibility of entering the world of software development, it seemed like the perfect bridge to make the two meet in the middle.
            
            I started the way I start anything: on paper (hence the cursor youâ€™re moving about the page with right now ðŸ˜€). Over the time I spent completing the application process, I discovered that a pen and sheet of paper are my favourite rubber ducks.
            
            What I love about software development, as Iâ€™ve got to experience it so far, is that it makes you break and surpass your limits in the most creative manner possible. When you are the designer of your universe, the sky is the limit. What I drew from the experience is that although coding definitely proved itself as a vast and initially intimidating field, I can definitely envision a future in which my analytical and innovative sides come together to create a stable and bright future, brick by brick and notion by notion, based on hard work and imagination.<br><br>
