        <span class="subtitle">I come from an interesting background of having experienced both 4 years of mathematics and informatics in a specialty high school back home, as well as sharpening my creative side of the mind by doing a BA in Performance Arts at the University of Westminster here in London. In the past, I have had a rather hard time choosing when it came to the direction of my career, simply because both parts of me demanded their rights. From this rather unique point of view, having experienced both the logic and accuracy of exact sciences as well as the more creative pursuits, I found in software development a place where both can flourish.
            One part that I find fascinating, as well as offering a true sense of empowerment, is the excitement and satisfaction of solving problems that seemed too difficult to tackle in the beginning. The joy of creation merged with the possibility of spending my days in a structured but creative environment was the initial thought that made me want to explore software development, and the more I uncovered and discovered, the more my decision felt justified.
